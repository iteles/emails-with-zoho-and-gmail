#Â Setting up your business email with Zoho Mail & Gmail
Set up your business email address for free using Zoho's free tier and manage it from your gmail account.

## Why?
When it comes to emails, the most common question we are asked by those who work with us is
>'How do I set up an email address so that it comes from my business domain name for free/cheaply? (e.g. *yournamehere*@dwyl.io)'

The next question is usually
> How do I manage this from gmail so I can send and receive all of my email from one place?

So we wrote up this quick how-to guide so that we had somewhere to direct folks to.

*Note: This focuses on Zoho Mail because at the time of writing it is the simplest free solution we have found for this purpose. However, the concepts of setting up email forwarding and aliasing can be adapted to other email providers.*

## What?
There are many ways to set yourself up with a business email, but these are the two options that we've found to be fastest/most effective:
+ **Set up Google Apps for Work**
  + You have to pay a small fee per user per month
  + You get additional storage and access to the full suite of Google Apps
  + Very guided set up with good customer service
  + *Is it worth the money?* We send out calendar invitations for calls and share Google docs regularly with clients. For us, having these come from a business email address and the convenience factor is worth the monthly fee 
+ **Set up a free email service (in this case Zoho Mail) and link it up to your regular Gmail inbox**
  + Free 
  + A bit more of a pain to set up (hence this small how-to)
  + Allows you to manage all of your emails in one place, from your Gmail inbox, using the interface you're used to
  + A great solution if you're bootstrapping a very early stage start up and can't invest anything in it just yet
    + You can still send calendar invites from your business email address but you need to use Zoho Mail directly

This short how-to helps you set up the second option: Zoho Mail with Gmail.
