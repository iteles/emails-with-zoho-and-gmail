#Â Setting up your business email with Zoho Mail & Gmail
Set up your business email address for free using Zoho's free tier and manage it from your gmail account.

## Why?
When it comes to emails, the most common question we are asked by those who work with us is
>'How do I set up an email address so that it comes from my business domain name? (e.g. *yournamehere*@dwyl.io)'

The next question is usually
> How do I manage this from gmail so I can send and receive all of my email from one place?

So we wrote up this quick how-to guide so that we had somewhere to direct folks to.

- [ ] How?
  - [ ] Set up Zoho Mail with MX & TXT records
  - [ ] Set up email forwarding in Zoho Mail
  - [ ] Set up alias in Gmail
  - [ ] Set up a label in gmail so it's very obvious
